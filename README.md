Golab
=====

A playground for experimenting with the Go Programming language.

The project is broken up into four main directories: Packages, Builtin, Utils, and Experiments.

* Packages - sample programs which use a particular package.
* Builtin - sample programs which use builtin features of Go (i.e. slices, arrays, etc)
* Utils - simple utilities. These are not necessarily useful or needed utils, but serve the purpose of learning to program in Go.
* Experiments - attempts to learn more about a features or technique in Go.
